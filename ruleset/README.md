RMCT Standard Ruleset
=======

This repository holds an older version of the RMCT Standard Ruleset because the people who updated it are morons. To propose changes to the ruleset, create an issue or a pull request. The actual ruleset is contained in the file ```index.md```.

The published ruleset is updated automatically when this file is updated, and the latest version can always be viewed at http://rmct.github.io/ruleset.
